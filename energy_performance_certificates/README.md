A concatenation and spatial aggregation of the recently released Energy Performance Certificates from the DCLG. We have aggregated them by output area and published the current and potential modal band (A-G) and median rating (0-100) across all assessed properties in the OA.

For each OA, we also publish the % of assessed properties that are or could be in band A, the total number of assessed properties and the numerical difference in the potential vs current median ratings.

We have only included the domestic EPC data. Where a property has had two or more assessments, we only take the values from the most recent assessment. The ONSPD open data product was used to assign an OA to each postcode.

The source data contains non-open data which is Copyright Royal Mail Group. The aggregating process removes this data (specifically, the individual address details, postcode and geographical location of that postcode or property). However the included Readme file, which relates to the source data, should continue to be consulted.
