Pre and Post Recession Town Centre Statistics
These data represent the composition and vacancy rates of retail centres in 2009 and 2014.

Records may be missing in both 2009 and 2014 data as LDC have expanded their survey coverage over time; and, retail centres may not be appropriately delineated through the DCLG definitions.
