Some datasets from my projects at UCL Geography's Geospatial Analysis and Computing (GSAC) research cluster. 

Mostly, these are open datasets which were not included with Version 2 of CDRC Data (https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/), so are included here instead of being deleted with the decommissioning of the old website.

In February 2020, CDRC launched Version 2 of CDRC Data, its data portal for open datasets collected, aggregated and enhanced by the ESRC CDRC (Consumer Data Research Centre) under its Open tier, along with listings, metadata and application forms for its non-open datasets categorised under the Safeguarded and Secure tiers.

Version 2 is a streamlined website and doesn't include a number of datasets that are nevertheless used by older maps on CDRC Data since its original 2015 launch, and/or are included in other minor projects and visualisations related to CDRC or aligned groups. They are therefore included here as an alternative source as the original version of CDRC Data was shut down in October 2020.

Almost all the datasets come from solely UK Government sources and therefore are under the Open Government Licence (OGL), an open data licence which requires attribution. The licence and attribution requirements are at http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/. There are some exceptions, for example the EPC data contains Royal Mail data and so is not under the OGL. Please see the licence file there for details.

The main CDRC Data website is at https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/, please do check there in the first instance for CDRC's Open datasets and Safeguarded and Secure data listings.
