Some datasets from various projects at UCL Geography's Geospatial Analysis and Computing (GSAC) research cluster, mostly relating to the former Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC). 

Mostly, these are open datasets which were not included with Version 2 of CDRC Data (https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/), so are included here instead of being deleted with the decommissioning of the old website. There are also a few which were retired along with CDRC in early 2025, but because CDRC acted as the canonical data store, they have been retained here so that the data is not lost. 

## Statement related to Retirement of CDRC Data Version 1 in February 2020

In February 2020, CDRC launched Version 2 of CDRC Data, its data portal for open datasets collected, aggregated and enhanced by the ESRC CDRC (Consumer Data Research Centre) under its Open tier, along with listings, metadata and application forms for its non-open datasets categorised under the Safeguarded and Secure tiers.

Version 2 is a streamlined website and doesn't include a number of datasets that are nevertheless used by older maps on CDRC Data since its original 2015 launch, and/or are included in other minor projects and visualisations related to CDRC or aligned groups. They are therefore included here as an alternative source as the original version of CDRC Data was shut down in October 2020.

Almost all the datasets come from solely UK Government sources and therefore are under the Open Government Licence (OGL), an open data licence which requires attribution. The licence and attribution requirements are at http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/. There are some exceptions, for example the EPC data contains Royal Mail data and so is not under the OGL. Please see the licence file there for details.

The main CDRC Data website is at https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/, please do check there in the first instance for CDRC's Open datasets and Safeguarded and Secure data listings.

## Statement related to Retirement of CDRC Data in June 2025

The Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) was a collaboration between two distinct research grants funded by the ESRC, each led by UCL and the University of Leeds.

Research funding is typically time-limited, and when the CDRC was established in 2014, it was intended to operate for five years. Its success attracted additional funding, allowing it to remain operational until April 2025. At that point, the ESRC ceased its support for the CDRC data service and instead created a larger Smart Data Research service (SDR UK).

We are pleased to announce that the majority of CDRC's data and activities have now been transferred to two new SDR UK services: the Geographic Data Service (led by UCL) and the SDR UK Healthy and Sustainable Places (led by the University of Leeds).
